# 03 — UI/UX & Design System (Premium Outdoors)

## Overall UX Goals
- “Apple-level polish” but outdoors-themed.
- Calm, premium, timeless. No neon/futuristic accents.
- Fast, thumb-friendly, minimal taps.

## Navigation (Recommended)
Keep main nav to <= 5 items. Recommended:
- Feed
- Explore
- Post (center primary action)
- Tools (Weather/Activity/Research)
- Trophy Wall

Land + Swap Shop can be:
- In Explore and Tools, OR
- Promoted to main tabs later if needed.

## Filters (Hard Requirement)
All state/county/species/season/price filters use:
- Modern dropdowns
- Searchable
- Big tap targets
- Fast (cached)
- “All counties” default with optional drill-down

## Card UI Patterns
- Photo-first cards with a compact “stats strip” (temp/wind/date/score/weight).
- Skeleton loaders.
- Empty states that feel intentional.

## Outdoors Theme (Tasteful)
- “Modern lodge” vibe: forest/charcoal/bone + muted earth accents.
- Avoid cheesy camo backgrounds, antler borders, distressed body fonts.
- Photos should dominate; UI is the frame.

## Terminology (Canonical)
- Trophy Wall (not profile)
- The Swap Shop (not marketplace)
- Harvested vs Posted (never assume time from upload)

## Accessibility
- Minimum contrast
- Scalable text support
- Large touch targets

## Performance Targets
- Smooth scroll feeds
- Aggressive image optimization & caching
- Fast filter application
- Offline-tolerant behaviors (drafting optional later)
