# 01 — Vision & Requirements (Locked)

## Product Summary
**The Skinning Shed** is a premium, modern, outdoors-themed community platform where people post hunting/fishing trophies with rich metadata and optional stories, organized by species and geography (State → County). It also includes first-class **Land for Lease / Land for Sale** listings, a discovery-only classifieds board (**The Swap Shop**), a **Weather** tab (including wind direction), **Activity/Feeding Times**, and an automatic **Research/Patterns** dashboard that aggregates trophy activity against historical conditions (barometric pressure, temperature, moon phase, wind, etc.) at State and County levels.

## MVP Philosophy
- **No v1 / no rework:** First public release must be production-quality.
- **High-tech operation:** fast, smooth, engineered.
- **Not “business/SaaS” look:** calm outdoors vibe; muted palette; no neon/flashy colors.
- **Privacy-first:** no GPS pins; no public exact coordinates.

## Platforms (Locked)
- **Web + iOS + Android** from day one with a shared codebase.

## Design Directive (Locked)
- Premium, modern, high-tech function.
- Outdoors “modern lodge” vibe.
- Photos are the hero; UI supports content.
- Consistent component system; no clutter.
- All filters use **modern searchable dropdowns**.

## Community Culture (Locked)
- Respect-first: reactions like “Respect” / “Well-earned” instead of influencer hearts.
- No politics, no arguing legality, no doxxing.
- Strong moderation tooling (report/hide/remove).

## Privacy & Safety (Locked)
- Public location is **State + County** only.
- No map pins in MVP.
- Private/journal mode supported for trophies.
- Analytics/Research is aggregated with minimum thresholds (avoid small-sample leakage).

## Out of Scope for MVP (Locked)
- GPS mapping / waypoints (onX/HuntStand-like features) — deferred until traction.
- Payments/escrow, transaction handling.
- DMs/messaging (optional later).
- Property boundary layers (licensed data; later).

## Key Terms (Canonical)
- User page: **Trophy Wall**
- Classifieds/BST: **The Swap Shop**
