# The Skinning Shed — Blueprint Pack (v1)

**Purpose:** This zip is the canonical, portable source-of-truth for *The Skinning Shed* project: vision, requirements, feature scope, UI rules, architecture, data model, build plan, and Cursor prompts.

**How to use in new chats**
1) Upload this zip at the start of a new chat.
2) Tell the assistant: “Use the uploaded Skinning Shed zip as the source of truth.”
3) When you say “save memory to start a new chat,” we will:
   - Update this zip with any new decisions/changes
   - Increment the version folder / changelog
   - Provide an updated download link

**Non‑negotiables (locked)**

- High-tech function + fast performance
- Web + iOS + Android from day one (shared codebase)
- MVP-first: production-ready on first launch (no throwaway v1)
- Privacy-first: **no GPS pins** / no exact public location; mapping/waypoints deferred
- Respect-first community and moderation rules
- Modern dropdown filters everywhere (state/county/species/etc.)
- “Trophy Wall” is the canonical term for each user’s personal page
- Buy/Sell/Trade tab is **“The Swap Shop”** (discovery-only classifieds; no payments)
